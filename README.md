### 🤖 Meet the Python Robot

Think of this project like giving Siemens Energy a **robot assistant powered by Python**.

Instead of humans doing boring copy-paste work all day, the robot:

* 📂 Devours factory data (yum)
* 🧹 Cleans the mess
* 📊 Draws pretty charts
* 🚨 Alerts if something’s wrong

**Basically:** less human headache, more smart factory magic.

---

### 🏭 Smart Factory Framework

Turn factories into **smart, automated factories** with low-cost, high-impact solutions:

* 🧹 Replace hours of manual reporting with **one click**
* 🚨 Catch mistakes before they become big problems
* 📊 Help managers and engineers **see data clearly**

**Result:** work faster, save money, and scale across Siemens Energy sites.

### 🔮 Coming Soon

* 📧 Emails/Slack alerts when something breaks
* 🤖 Predict machine tantrums before they happen
* ☁️ Dashboards in the cloud so everyone can see the magic

💡 **Bottom line:** Python robot = faster work, less waste, happier factories.

## ⚡ One-Click Quick Start

Run the full setup—Python 3.11 Conda environment, all required packages, Jupyter extensions, and launch Jupyter Lab—in **two simple steps**.

### Linux / macOS / WSL

1️⃣ Download the setup script

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/HeiderJeffer/Siemens-Energy-Digitalization-Transformation-Engineer/raw/main/One-Click%20Environment%20Setup/setup_env.sh
```

2️⃣ Run the script

```
bash setup_env.sh
```

> This reliably downloads and executes the script in WSL/Linux/macOS. No manual permission changes needed.



### Windows (Command Prompt / PowerShell)

```powershell
powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/HeiderJeffer/Siemens-Energy-Digitalization-Transformation-Engineer/raw/main/One-Click%20Environment%20Setup/setup_env.bat -OutFile setup_env.bat; .\setup_env.bat"
```

> This downloads the batch file and executes it automatically.
