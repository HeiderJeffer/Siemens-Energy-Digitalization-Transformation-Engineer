# ⚡ Smart Factory Digitalization Framework

**Transforming Siemens Energy’s factories with low-cost, high-impact automation.**

This prototype demonstrates how **Python and open-source tools** can replace hours of repetitive manual reporting with a **fully automated workflow** that:

* 📂 Ingests Excel factory reports
* 🧹 Cleans, validates, and monitors data quality
* 📊 Generates daily production summaries automatically
* 🚨 Detects anomalies in real-time
* 📈 Produces clear dashboards for managers and engineers

**Key benefits:**

* ⏱ 20–30% reduction in repetitive reporting
* 💰 Estimated €60k–180k yearly savings (Trento site)
* 🌍 Scalable across Siemens Energy’s global factory network



# ⚡ One-Click Quick Start

Run the full setup—Python 3.11 Conda environment, all required packages, Jupyter extensions, and launch Jupyter Lab—in **two simple steps**.

### Linux / macOS / WSL

1️⃣ Download the setup script

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/HeiderJeffer/Siemens-Energy-Digitalization-Transformation-Engineer/raw/main/One-Click%20Environment%20Setup/setup_env.sh
```

2️⃣ Run the script

```
bash setup_env.sh
```

> This reliably downloads and executes the script in WSL/Linux/macOS. No manual permission changes needed.



### Windows (Command Prompt / PowerShell)

```powershell
powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/HeiderJeffer/Siemens-Energy-Digitalization-Transformation-Engineer/raw/main/One-Click%20Environment%20Setup/setup_env.bat -OutFile setup_env.bat; .\setup_env.bat"
```

> This downloads the batch file and executes it automatically.
